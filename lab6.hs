  rad :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]  -- Remove adjacent duplicates
  rad [] = []
  rad [x] = [x]
  rad (x:ys@(y:zs)) | x == y = rad ys
                    | otherwise = x : rad ys

-- Cartesian product (preserves normalization)
(><) :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
xs >< ys = [(x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys]

-- Powerset  (preserves normalization)
power :: [a] -> [[a]]
power [] = [[]]
power (x:xs) = let ys = power xs
               in [] : map (x:) ys ++ tail ys

-- Check whether two lists overlap
overlap :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
overlap [] ys = False
overlap (x:xs) ys = elem x ys || overlap xs ys
